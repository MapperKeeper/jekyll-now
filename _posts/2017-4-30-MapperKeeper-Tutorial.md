author: Joshua Tanner

[MapperKeeper](https://www.mapperkeeper.com) is an online platform for telling stories with maps.  It has useful tools and intuitive workflows to help you create and share your map with others.  To help you get started, we built this tutorial that walks you through each step of building [this map](https://www.mapperkeeper.com/maps/df36ae21-3bb6-4909-8b51-87d00f1c4146).

## What We're Buidling

We're building a map to show the 2018 Boston Marathon and adding a rooftop bar location for those that prefer to experience the event with a beer in hand!  These spectators need to know where to watch the race and also see the marathon route.  In this tutorial we will talk about adding GeoJSON files, linking to pictures and YouTube videos, and sharing your creation on Twitter.  

## Step 1: Linking Your Social Media Accounts

Linking your social media accounts with your MapperKeeper account let's you quickly share your creations with Twitter and Facebook.  Once linked, you can share a summary and picture of your map to social media with a single click.  On the dashboard page, ** link your desired social media accounts ** by clicking *link account* in the left sidebar.
