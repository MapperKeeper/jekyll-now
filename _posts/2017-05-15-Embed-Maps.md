A primary goal [MapperKeeper](https://www.mapperkeeper.com) is to make it easier to share your maps.  In the previous tutorial, I showed you how to create your first map and share it on social media.  If you already have your own website or blog, why not add your beautiful MapperKeeper map directy on your site?  Let's talk about embedding maps!

## Create or Edit Existing Map

If you already haven't create a map already, you will need to create one.  You can follow along with our previous tutorial for [building your first map](/MapperKeeper-Tutorial/) with MapperKeeper.  If you already have a map created, you can select the `edit` option from your map dashboard.

## Select Share

From your map editor page, you can make any edits you need to your map or story.  Once you are finished, save your map and then click the `share` option on the bottom right.

## Copy Embed Snippet

The embed snippet contains the code that you will need to add the MapperKeeper map directly on your own website.  Copy the `iframe` code to your clipboard and paste it on your site.

The snippet should look like this:

```html
<iframe 
  src='https://www.mapperkeeper.com/maps/df36ae21-3bb6-4909-8b51-87d00f1c4146?mode=embed' 
  height='600px' width='100%'></iframe>
```

Feel free to adjust the height and width to best fit your own website.

## Show Off

Now your beautiful MapperKeeper map is proudly displayed on your site.  Feel free to lean back, throw your feet up, and admire how nice that new and shiny map looks!  The best thing is, any changes made to the original map will automatically show up on your site.

Take a look at our example below.
